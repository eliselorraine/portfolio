                <p className="about_paragraph">My coding journey started in February 2021, when I started playing with HTML, CSS, and Javascript through courses on
                    freeCodeCamp.org. I was quickly hooked, and after many hours of my own practice I found myself
                    invited to participate in the intensive <a className="about_salt" href="https://salt.dev/">&lt;/salt&gt;</a> bootcamp in Stockholm, Sweden.
                    There, I was trained professionally as a full-stack Javascript developer.</p>
