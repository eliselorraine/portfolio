            My coding journey started in February 2021, when I started playing with HTML, CSS, and Javascript through courses on
            freeCodeCamp.org. I was quickly hooked, and after many hours of my own practice I found myself
            invited to participate in the intensive &lt;/salt&gt; bootcamp in Stockholm, Sweden. There, I was trained
            professionally as a full-stack Javascript developer. I am particularly intrigued by creative frontend technologies and
            like to focus on creating clean, well-structured solutions.
